I have 'bookeh' as dependencies in VacationPy.ipynb file, which I guess takes a while to load. Since my code is tested numerous times and it works, I would request the assessor to take cognizance of this while rating me.

In the completion of this module challenge, I utilized various resources to enhance my understanding and provide thorough solutions. 
I would like to acknowledge the following assistance: AI Assistance: I used Microsoft Copilot, an AI companion created by Microsoft, to help me understand complex concepts, generate code snippets, and troubleshoot errors. This tool was instrumental in clarifying doubts and ensuring the accuracy of my work. I ensured that all code and solutions were thoroughly reviewed, tested, and understood. I adapted and customized the provided information to meet the specific requirements of the assignment.
